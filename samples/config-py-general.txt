# Add any Sphinx extension module names here, as strings. They can be
# extensions coming with Sphinx (named 'sphinx.ext.*') or your custom
# ones.
# Install cloud_sptheme with the following command:
# pip install cloud_sptheme
extensions = [
    'sphinx.ext.autodoc',

	'sphinx.ext.githubpages',
]

# Add any paths that contain templates here, relative to this directory.

# The suffix(es) of source filenames.
# You can specify multiple suffix as a list of string:

# The encoding of source files.
#source_encoding = 'utf-8-sig'

# The master toctree document.

#
# The short X.Y version.
version = '0.1'
# The full version, including alpha/beta/rc tags.

# This is also used if you do content translation via gettext catalogs.
# Usually you set "language" from the command line for these cases.

# There are two options for replacing |today|: either, you set today to some
# non-false value, then it is used:
#today = ''
# Else, today_fmt is used as the format for a strftime call.
